# Design-of-low-power-SR-flip-flop-with-on-off-ONOFIC-implementation
Due to the superior scalability of the device structure, MOSFET-based ICs have constantly delivered cost reductions in semiconductor chips for data processing and memory. However, it is not without its shortcomings. 

In the nanoscale world, the most important ones are leakage power dissipation and propagation latency. Leakage power contributes more and more to total power dissipation. There are various techniques to reduce leakage in literature, each with its advantages and cons. One such implementation is the use of on-off logic, which includes two extra inserted transistors. 

In this study, the current ONOFIC methodology is upgraded and compared with pre-existing approaches. The improved ONOFIC methodology outperforms traditional and leakage control NMOS transistor (LCNT) approaches in simulations. 

This report also highlights and compares various other leakage power reduction techniques with the modified proposed circuit concerning power, delay and other factors. Further, a comparison between the circuits based on technology nodes has also been explored.
